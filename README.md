# The To Do List 

I built a simple to do list to display my understanding of NodeJS, Express.js, HTTP Methods, RESTful API and many other skills!


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, Embedded JS, MongoDB, Postman, Git/Github, Heroku


## Optimizations

In the future, I plan to make the app look more appealing and mobile first. 
I also plan on adding additional features like authentication so that different people can use the app at the same time
